    <h2>WEB</h2>
    <p>
      English scientist Sir Timothy Berners-Lee invented the World 
      Wide Web in 1989. He wrote the first web browser in 1990 while 
      employed at CERN near Geneva, Switzerland.[3][4] The browser was 
      released outside CERN to other research institutions starting in
      January 1991, and then to the general public in August 1991. 
      The Web began to enter everyday use in 1993-4, when websites for 
      general use started to become available.[5] The World Wide Web has 
      been central to the development of the Information Age, and is the 
      primary tool billions of people use to interact on the Internet.

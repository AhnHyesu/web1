      We believe...We believe that there are too many 
      bottles of perfume and not enough soulful fragrances
      We believe the soul of a fragrance comes from the 
      intention with which it is created and the attention 
      with which it is prepared We believe fine perfumery must create 
      a shock - the shock of the new, combined with the shock of the 
      intimately familiaWe believe that fine perfumery must be irreverent
      We believe it is more humane to test cosmetics on New Yorkers 
      than on animals We believe celebrities should pay full price
      We believe the future of luxury (hence of perfumery) lies in 
      craftsmanship We believe in the soulful power of thoughtful hands: 
      hand-picked roses, hand-poured candles, hand-formulated perfumes and
      handshake agreementsWe believe in the passionate souls who work close
      to us We believe in Hafiz's take on life : "Act great, dear. Always
      act great" We believe New York made us this way, with a dose of 
      Wabi-Sabi and a few lines from Thoreau We believe we/you should put 
      away our modern tools and take the time to smell the roses along the 
      way We believe that we are only young once, but we can be immature 
      forever And we believe that explanation kills art. Therefore, 
      forget about all of this
